/*general info :
 * distributor -> sends and signals CPU regarding interrupt
 * 	-> receives the interrupt signals
 * 	-> forwarding interrupt signals to CPU GIC controller
 * 	-> enabling / disabling interrupts
 * 	-> setting priorities to interrupts
 * 	-> setting target processor of the interrupts (which interrupt signal will be feed into which CPU)
 * 	-> setting interrupt level sensitivity or edge triggered (sensitivity) option
 * CPU interface -> acks interrupts and distributor
 * 	-> enabling signalling of interrupt requests by CPU
 * 	-> acknowledging interrupts
 * 	-> indicating compilation of processing of an interrupt
 * GIC controller*/

/*procedure :
 * initialize distributor
 * initalize CPU interface
 * initialize GIC instance
